# BringaTrailer-Data-Scraping

This script was developed to scrape specific auction data for vehicles from https://bringatrailer.com. The data you scrape can be used for analysis purposes to determine the recent trends of vehicle prices, as well as what to pay if you are looking to purchase one of these vehicles soon.

Very basic script, but it gets the job done :)
